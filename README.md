5. render backend is hosted here: https://finzie-gj1a.onrender.com

## Task for hackathon
1. Whole backend has been completed so only frontend needs to be done
2. Only need to work on files under /screens dir
3. Look at [this](https://www.figma.com/file/nhknxoOvtkg03O6QWBt33B/FINZIE?type=design&node-id=201%3A981&t=ewt3mBQwZ4UfnvTc-1) figma design
4. Need to design screens just like this
5. Can add new styles or animations to beautify the screens, bonus points will be awarded to this
6. There are several flutter nocode platforms such as Flutterflow, FlutterViz, Nowa and blup.
7. There are also platforms that directly convert figma design to flutter frontend code such as Dhiwise, Function12
8. If you use these above platforms it will add to bonus points because we believe speed is the key to move forward
9. When completed add whole screenshots to the readme as well as demo recording
11. Add your submission to this [form](https://forms.gle/tGULYAZRo7hVFGAt5)
